# 🃏 SHOW — A Strategic Battle to Stay Low!

Welcome to **SHOW**, a thrilling card game where your mission isn't to dominate with power cards — it's to **vanish in plain sight with the lowest sum**! ✨

Think you're sitting pretty with a low hand? Then go ahead, **call "Show"** — but be warned: if someone’s even sneakier, you’ll pay the price! 💥

---

## 🎯 Objective

Your goal: **Have the lowest total card value in your hand** when a “Show” is called.  
After a set number of rounds or once someone crosses a point limit, the player with the **lowest score overall wins**. 🏆

---

## 🧩 Game Setup

- 🃎 **Deck Size**: Based on the number of players.
  - 2–4 players → Use 1–2 decks.
  - 5–9 players → Use 2–3 decks.
- 🂠 **Dealing Cards**: Each player receives **7 cards**.
- 🔁 **Draw Pile + Discard**: Remaining cards go to the draw pile. One card starts the discard pile face-up.

---

## 🔄 Game Play

Players take turns **clockwise**. On your turn, choose one:

### ✨ Play Cards:
- Must match the **rank** (number/face) of the top discard pile card.
- You can play **multiple cards of the same rank** (e.g., three 9s).
- If discard pile is empty, you may play any one or set of same-rank cards.

### ➕ Draw a Card:
- If you can't (or don’t want to) play, **draw one card**.
- After drawing, your turn ends — you **cannot play** a card that turn.

> Matching is strictly by **rank**, not suit (e.g., 5♠ matches 5♥).

## 🚨 Calling "Show"

After **2 complete rounds**, a player can call **“Show”** on their turn if they believe they hold the **lowest sum**.

### ✅ If Correct:
- You get **0 points**.
- Everyone else gets points equal to the total value of cards in their hand.

### ❌ If Incorrect (someone has less or ties with you):
- You get a **50-point penalty**.
- The actual lowest-scoring player gets 0.
- All others score their hand as usual.
